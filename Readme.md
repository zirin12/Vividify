Image labeller game
The website looks forward to acheive IMAGE 
SEARCH through tags given by the user's.This is
GOOGLE's IMAGE LABELLER in a RE-INVENTED form.
The website is self-explanatory.

Pre-requisitives for the project:
1.Download the WEB_tech.sql file from the folder 
  and set the MySQL functionality
  [Exclusively Xampp v.3.2.2 and above]

2.Check if all images are present.


PROJECT:

1.)-The project is DESIGNED for assigning images specific tags for search purpose.(an early version of how google gamified this process and made it into google images)
- A user is shown images for which he has to type tags describing that image(this is done in a gamified manner) all of which are stored in a backend database and in our search page we can type a tag in the search bar which will display all the images assigned to this tag.
2.)-vividify_dsx is a minigame based on a variation of edit distance 
 where on providing a start word and end word the player has to
type in all the valid intermediate words such that each of those words 
is a valid english word and it differs from the previous word by either 
substitution,deletion or insertion of a letter.(implemented as a graph where shortest path is determined by BFS algorithm.)
-This project of ours is also greatly gamified to include various features like stop timers,points,leaderboard,hints for the next  intermediate word as a definition of the word(for whivh we used the dictionary rest API to fetch the defintion of a given word)
